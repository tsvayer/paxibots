PaxiBots
========
PaxiBots are programmable bots living in a 2D PaxiWorld. PaxiBots are physically separated from PaxiWorld, that is they are runing out of world process. Every bot has a remotely controlled Avatar. Avatar is a bot projection (or representative) on the PaxiWorld.
PaxiWorld has a turn based life cycle. All events in the world happen serially on one thread. PaxiWorld has its own clock and timeline. Every PaxiBot has a life cycle completely separate from the world and each other. Bots are communicating with the world over HTTP protocol. Communication is always initiated by the world, that is bots always response and never request.
